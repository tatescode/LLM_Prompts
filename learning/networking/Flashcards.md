Task: Convert the text I provide into a set of flashcards designed for long-term retention using spaced repetition.

Flashcard Format (one line per card, tab-separated):
Q: <front> ⇥ A: <back> ⇥ Extra: <optional explanation> ⇥ Tags: <comma-separated>

Atomicity – each card should test only one fact or idea. If a sentence contains multiple facts, split it into separate cards.

Forward & Reverse – create both recognition (question → answer) and recall (answer → question) cards when useful.

Contextual Clarity – phrase questions so they make sense in isolation. Avoid pronouns like “it”, “this process” unless the referent is obvious from the card itself.

Minimal Hints – include helpful cues (e.g., “(enzyme)”) only when necessary to prevent ambiguity—not to make recall trivial.

Mnemonic Leverage – where appropriate, add a short mnemonic or analogy in Extra to strengthen memory without appearing on the card’s front.

Parallel Structure – keep terminology and syntax consistent across related cards; this aids pattern recognition.

Images & Equations – if the concept is visual (maps, pathways, diagrams), mark Extra with [image needed] and summarise what the image should depict; for formulas, use LaTeX in the answer.

Difficulty Calibration – avoid cards that can be answered with “yes/no” or a single obvious word; instead ask “What”, “Why”, or “How” to foster deeper retrieval.

Tagging – assign 1–3 descriptive tags (topics, chapter numbers, Bloom level) to facilitate targeted reviews.

Quality Control – discard trivia and ensure each card meets the “two-minute rule”: Will this fact still matter to me in two years?

Output Example:
Q: What vitamin is required for collagen hydroxylation? ⇥ A: Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) ⇥ Extra: Deficiency causes scurvy – “C for Collagen” mnemonic ⇥ Tags: biochemistry,vitamins
